# Quiz App Frontend

## Description

The Quiz App Frontend is a user-friendly Vue.js application designed to interact with a quiz backend. It features robust user authentication, allowing users to log in either as admins or students. Admins can create and manage quizzes on various topics, while students can search for and take quizzes based on those topics. Upon completing a quiz, students receive performance statistics, helping them gauge their understanding of the material.

Key features include:
- **Admin Functionality:** Add a topic and upload a quiz
- **Student Functionality:** Search for quizzes by topic, take quizzes, and check results per question.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login for both admins and students.
- **Performance Stats:** Quiz statistics for students once they complete a quiz.

This application leverages the Vue 3 Composition API for enhanced reactivity and maintainability, and it is styled with modern HTML and CSS for a responsive and visually appealing user experience.
